# Nanoframe

**Nanoframe** is a minimalist, dependency-free Python data processing library. It offers intuitive, performant in-memory data structures (`NanoFrame` and `NanoSeries`) for handling tabular and columnar data efficiently and easily.

---

## Features

- Core data structures for frames (`NanoFrame`) and series (`NanoSeries`)
- CSV and JSON input/output
- Intelligent type inference and formatting
- Missing data handling (fill, drop)
- Arithmetic, aggregation, and filtering operations
- Chainable, Pythonic APIs for clear code
- Lightweight with no heavy dependencies
- Easy to extend and customize

df = NanoFrame(data)

print(df)

print("Average score:", df["score"].mean())
```
